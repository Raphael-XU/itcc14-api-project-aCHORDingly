### Milestone 1 (Nov Week 1): Project Proposal & Introduction

- **What we'll do:**
  - Finalize project topic and objectives (aCHORDingly Web Service).
  - Define the problem statement — lack of an open resource API for chord diagram generation.
  - Outline data models for key entities.
  - Complete Chapters 1 & 2 of the ITCC14 Final Project Document (Introduction and Web Service Architecture).
  - Draft initial REST API plan (e.g., /chords, /analytics, /lyrics).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Updated README.md containing:
  - Overview of the Project
  - Statement of the Problem
  - Objectives
  - Scope and Limitations
  - Completed ITCC14 Final Project Document (Chapters 1 and 2).
  - Initial api.yaml (or Postman collection) listing core planned endpoints.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Hold team meeting to finalize topic
  - [ ] Define fields for Chord, Instrument, and User models
  - [ ] Complete Chapters 1 and 2 of ITCC14 document
  - [ ] Create initial api.yaml and add endpoints (/chords, /analytics, /lyrics)
  - [ ] Commit and push all files to GitHub

### Milestone 2 (Nov Week 2): Half API + Half Documentation + Git/GitHub

- **What we'll do:**
  - Initialize repository and environment.
  - Implement core endpoints for the Chord resource.
  - Document REST API architecture and test using Postman.
  - Add OpenAPI documentation with request and response schemas and example chord responses.
  - Begin Chapter 3 (REST API Specifications) of ITCC14 document.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Running backend with basic /chords endpoints working.
  - Updated api_documentation.yaml with examples.
  - Updated GitHub repository (with README linking to documentation).
  - Draft version of Chapter 3 for ITCC14 document.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Repo created and initial commit
  - [ ] Dependencies installed 
  - [ ] Core /chords endpoints created
  - [ ] API documentation started 
  - [ ] Chapter 3 of ITCC14 document started
  - [ ] Changes committed and pushed

### Milestone 3 (Nov Week 3): Full Backend API

- **What you’ll do:**
  - Implement remaining endpoints (/analytics, /lyrics, etc.).
  - Add validation, error handling (400, 404), and response consistency.
  - Seed the database with sample chord data.
  - Validate OpenAPI schema to ensure completeness.
- **Deliverables:**
  - All planned endpoints working and tested.
  - Seed script with sample chords (for example, C major, A minor).
  - Validated OpenAPI specification (no schema errors).
  - Updated project documentation and screenshots of working API.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] All endpoints implemented (/chords, /analytics, /lyrics)
  - [ ] Input validation and error handling
  - [ ] Seed data included
  - [ ] OpenAPI validated and error-free

### Milestone 4 (Nov Week 4): Frontend Integration

- **What you’ll do:**
  - Frontend will be utilized using Postman or Swagger.
  - Integrate API endpoints for listing and viewing chord diagrams.
  - Handle loading and error states.
  - Prepare deployment option.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Frontend that connects to backend API (displays chord diagrams dynamically).
  - Updated README.md with setup instructions.
  - Demo-ready local environment.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Frontend lists chords correctly
  - [ ] Frontend fetches diagrams via API
  - [ ] Handles errors and loading states
  - [ ] Documentation updated for demo

### Final (Dec Week 2): Full Demo & Presentation

- **What you’ll do:**
  - Present project: aCHORDingly Web Service using REST.
  - Demonstrate working endpoints, frontend integration, and API documentation.
  - Show OpenAPI docs and discuss how it aligns with implementation.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Presentation slides summarizing:
  - Problem, Objectives, and Architecture
  - Demo workflow
  - Repository link with full documentation.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Slides finalized
  - [ ] Demo data seeded
  - [ ] Backup plan (screenshots/videos) prepared
